Thrilled to share my latest end-to-end data analytics project where I performed an in-depth Crime Pattern Analysis across Indian States ðŸ“Š.
What I Did:
 âœ… Cleaned, processed, and standardized crime data from data.gov.in
 âœ… Explored crime category distributions with insightful visualizations
 âœ… Built a Crime Severity Score using feature importances from Random Forest
 âœ… Identified Top 10 Crime Hotspot States
 âœ… Performed Correlation Analysis to find crime interdependencies
 âœ… Applied PCA + KMeans Clustering to classify states into High, Moderate, and Low Crime clusters
 âœ… Developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard for on-the-fly state-wise crime insights
 
Key Outcomes:
 âœ¨ Pinpointed states with the highest severity scores
 âœ¨ Mapped clustering patterns across India
 âœ¨ Delivered a seamless interactive dashboard for policy planners and researchers
